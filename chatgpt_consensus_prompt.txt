CONSENSUS CELL TYPE ANNOTATION PROMPT FOR ChatGPT
====================================================

I have single-cell RNA-seq data with cell type annotations from 5 independent runs. I need you to analyze the consensus and determine the final annotation for each cell.

**CONTEXT:**
- Data source: [MODIFY: e.g., "human PBMC peripheral blood mononuclear cells"]
- CSV format: Cell_Barcode, Coarse_Run_1, Coarse_Run_2, Coarse_Run_3, Coarse_Run_4, Coarse_Run_5, Fine_Run_1, Fine_Run_2, Fine_Run_3, Fine_Run_4, Fine_Run_5

**DECISION RULES (apply in order):**

1. **MAJORITY CONSENSUS (≥3/5):** If 3+ runs agree → use that annotation
   - Example: T cells, T cells, T cells, NK cells, B cells → Final: T cells

2. **BIOLOGICAL SIMILARITY:** If related but not identical → use common ancestor
   - Example: CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, T cells, Helper T cells, T cells → Final: T cells
   - Example: Classical Monocytes, Non-classical Monocytes, Monocytes → Final: Monocytes

3. **QUALITY FILTER:** Avoid technical artifacts, gene names, or NUMBERS
   - Reject: "Ribosomal protein", "Unknown cluster 5", "T cells 1", "Lymphocytes 2", obvious errors
   - Remove: ALL numbered suffixes (e.g., "B cells 1" → "B cells")
   - Prefer: established cell types for your tissue

4. **CONSERVATIVE CHOICE:** When uncertain → use broader category or "Unknown"
   - If completely contradictory → "Unknown"
   - NEVER use numbers in final annotations

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Create a CSV with exactly these columns:
```
barcode,coarse,fine
AAACATACAACCAC-1,T cells,T cells
AAACATTGAGCTAC-1,B cells,B cells
AAACGCTTCTCTGTAT-1,Unknown,Unknown
```

**ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Upload the consensus CSV file
2. For each cell, analyze both coarse and fine annotations across 5 runs
3. Apply decision rules systematically
4. Create the final barcode,coarse,fine CSV
5. Provide a brief summary of consensus patterns

**EXPECTED CELL TYPES for [TISSUE]:**
[MODIFY based on your tissue - examples below for PBMC:]
- T cells (CD4+, CD8+, regulatory, memory, naive)
- B cells (naive, memory, plasma cells)  
- NK cells (CD56dim, CD56bright)
- Monocytes (classical, intermediate, non-classical)
- Dendritic cells (myeloid, plasmacytoid)
- Other tissue-specific types

**EXAMPLE DECISION PROCESS:**

Cell: AAACATACAACCAC-1
- Coarse: T cells, T cells, Lymphocytes, T cells, T cells (4/5 → T cells)
- Fine: CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, T cells, CD4+ T cells, T cells (mixed → T cells)
- Final: T cells, T cells

Cell: AAACATTGAGCTAC-1
- Coarse: B cells 1, B cells 2, B cells, B cells 1, B cells (clean numbers → B cells)
- Fine: Lymphocytes 1, B cells 2, B cells, Naive B cells, B cells (majority B cells → B cells)
- Final: B cells, B cells

Cell: AAACGCTTCTCTGTAT-1  
- Coarse: NK cells, T cells, Monocytes, B cells, Dendritic cells (no consensus)
- Fine: NK cells, CD8+ T cells, Classical Monocytes, Naive B cells, Myeloid DC (no consensus)
- Final: Unknown, Unknown

Please analyze my consensus file and provide the final barcode,coarse,fine CSV.
